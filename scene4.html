    <p><b>Scene 4: </b>
      The line graph above displays the rolling averages of cases per 100K individuals across the 6 least vaccine-receptive states with the lowest vaccination rates, using data provided by The New York Times.
      Users can toggle the button to see the development of COVID-19 cases in each of the six states &dash; Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Wyoming &dash; since the beginning of the pandemic
      in February 2020. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since vaccinations have become more accessible and prevalent since February 2021, especially since March, we can observe a decline or maintenance in cases in all six states.
      As of the end of June 2021, the average cases per 100,000 individuals are: X in Alabama, X in Arkansas, X in Idaho, X in Louisiana, X in Mississippi, and X in Wyoming.
      However, the decline in cases observed above is not as significant as the decline in cases witnessed in the six states displayed in Scene 3. Take, for instance, Wyoming. 
      The average cases per 100,000 individuals in Wyoming seems to remain consistent since March 2021. In fact, in Arkansas, we can observe an increase in cases throughout June 2021, which lines up with the rise in COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant.
      Meanwhile, all states presented in Scene 3 did not show any increase.
    </p>
    <p>     
      From the following insights throughout this visualization, we can safely conclude that states with higher vaccination rates and lower vaccine hesitancy are more likely to protect individuals from COVID-19, thereby reducing COVID-19 cases on a greater scale than
      states with low vaccination rates and high vaccine hesitancy.

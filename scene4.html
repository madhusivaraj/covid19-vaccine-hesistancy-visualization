    <p><b>Scene 4: </b>
      The line graph above displays the rolling averages of cases per 100K individuals across the 6 least vaccine-receptive states with the lowest vaccination rates, using data provided by The New York Times.
      Users can toggle the button to see the development of COVID-19 cases in each of the six states &dash; Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Wyoming &dash; since the beginning of the pandemic
      in February 2020. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Because vaccinations have become more accessible and prevalent since February 2021, especially since March, we can observe a decline or maintenance in cases in all six states.
      On June 16, 2021, the total cases were: 160 in Alabama, 288 in Arkansas, 87 in Idaho, 325 in Louisiana, 83 in Mississippi, and 56 in Wyoming.
      The average cases per 100,000 individuals were: 4.31 in Alabama, 8.19 in Arkansas, 4.97 in Idaho, 6.57 in Louisiana, 3.96 in Mississippi, and 10.32 in Wyoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the decline in cases observed above is not as significant as the decline in cases witnessed in the six states displayed in Scene 3. 
      Take, for instance, Wyoming. The average cases per 100,000 individuals in Wyoming seems to remain consistent since March 2021. In fact, in Arkansas, we can observe an increase in cases throughout June 2021, which lines up with the rise in COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant.
      Meanwhile, all states presented in Scene 3 did not show any increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average cases per 100K range for the 6 most vaccine-receptive states with the highest vaccination rates (Scene 3) range from 1.1 to 2.95. 
      Meanwhile, the average cases per 100K range for the 6 least vaccine-receptive states with the lowest vaccination rates (Scene 3) range from 3.96 to 10.32.
    </p>
    <p>     
      From the following insights throughout this visualization, we can safely conclude that states with higher vaccination rates and lower vaccine hesitancy are more likely to achieve herd immunity
      from COVID-19, thereby reducing COVID-19 cases on a greater scale than states with low vaccination rates and high vaccine hesitancy. 
      Hence, greater vaccine hesitancy has a negative impact on the spread of COVID-19 cases.

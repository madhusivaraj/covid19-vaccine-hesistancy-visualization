    <p><b>Scene 3: </b>
      The line graph above displays the rolling averages of cases per 100K individuals across the 6 most vaccine-receptive states with the highest vaccination rates, using data provided by The New York Times.
      Users can toggle the button to see the development of COVID-19 cases in each of the six states &dash; Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont &dash; since the beginning of the pandemic
      in February 2020. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since vaccinations have become more accessible and prevalent since February 2021, especially since April, we can observe a huge drop in cases in all six states.
      As of the end of June 2021, the average cases per 100,000 individuals are: X in Connecticut, X in Massachusetts, X in New Jersey, X in New York, X in Rhode Island, and X in Vermont.

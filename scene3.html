    <p><b>Scene 3: </b>
      The line graph above displays the rolling averages of cases per 100K individuals across the 6 most vaccine-receptive states with the highest vaccination rates, using data provided by The New York Times.
      Users can toggle the button to see the development of COVID-19 cases in each of the six states &dash; Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont &dash; since the beginning of the pandemic
      in February 2020. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since vaccinations have become more accessible and prevalent since February 2021, especially since April, we can observe a huge drop in cases in all six states.
      On July 16, 2021, the total cases were: 39 in Connecticut, 68 in Massachusetts, 283 in New Jersey, 286 in New York, 27 in Rhode Island, and 9 in Vermont.
      The average cases per 100,000 individuals were: 1.19 in Connecticut, 1.29 in Massachusetts, 2.95 in New Jersey, 2.22 in New York, 2.43 in Rhode Island, and 1.1 in Vermont.

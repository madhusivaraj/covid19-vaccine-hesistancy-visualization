    <p><b>Scene 2: </b>
      Vermont has the highest percentage of its population fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to Bloomberg's COVID-19 vaccine distribution data tracker.
      The above graphic ranks states by the percentage of their population that has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the CDC standards.
      When comparing the top 10 states with the highest vaccinated populations with the insights identified from Scene 1, we can identify that
      Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont are the most vaccine-receptive and have the highest vaccination rates.
      Similarily, when comparing the top 10 states with the lowest vaccinated populations with the findins from the previous scene, we see that
      Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Wyoming are the most vaccine-hesitant and have the lowest vaccination rates. 
    </p>

      The bar chart above displays the percentage of populations that have received the COVID-19 vaccines using data provided by Bloomberg's Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker. Vaccination data is gathered from government websites, official statements and Bloomberg interviews.
      The data used for this graphic is publicly available and can be accessed at: <a href="https://github.com/BloombergGraphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-data" target="_blank">https://github.com/BloombergGraphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-data</a>

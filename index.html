    <p>COVID-19 is a dangerous disease caused by a virus discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. 
      COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much like a cold, a flu, or pneumonia, but COVID-19 can also harm other parts of the body.
      It is very contagious and has quickly spread around the world, resulting in over 198 million cases and 4.22 million deaths globally.

      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      so it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development. WHO is working tirelessly with partners to develop, 
      manufacture and deploy safe and effective vaccines. But it’s not vaccines that will stop the pandemic, it’s vaccination. We must ensure fair and 
      equitable access to vaccines, and ensure every country receives them and can roll them out to protect their people, starting with the most vulnerable.
      However, a significant portion of the American population has not yet been vaccinated, citing vaccine hesitancy as one of the primary reasons.

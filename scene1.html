    <p><b>Scene 1: </b>
      Getting vaccinated prevents severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. 
      The CDC recommends that unvaccinated people should get vaccinated and continue masking until 
      they are fully vaccinated. With the Delta variant, this is more urgent than ever. 

      However, vaccine hesitancy in regards to COVID-19 is prevalent across the nation.
      Vaccine hesitancy is a delay in acceptance, or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccine services. 
      Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place and vaccines. 
      It is influenced by factors such as complacency, convenience, confidence and lack of understanding about how vaccines work.
      The term covers outright refusals to vaccinate, delaying vaccines, accepting vaccines but remaining uncertain about their use, 
      or using certain vaccines but not others. Among the hesitant are groups known as "anti-vaxxers" or "anti-vax", who are generally against vaccination.
